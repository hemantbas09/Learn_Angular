It is a special type of subject from the RxJs library. It store a single value and emit it to new subscribers immediately upon subscription.It is used for manage start accross multiple component.

use case:
1. State Management:
2. Component Communication:
3. Data Sharing:

### **Use Signals**  
- For **local component state** (e.g., counters, form toggles).  
- When you want **automatic reactivity** and clean API.  
- For **simple and predictable updates** without subscriptions.  
- Best for **small-scale state management** in Angular.

### **Use BehaviorSubject**  
- For **shared state** across multiple components (e.g., user authentication, themes).  
- When handling **asynchronous data** (e.g., API calls, WebSockets).  
- If you need **RxJS operators** for combining or transforming streams.  
- Best for **complex workflows** and event-driven systems.  

### **Quick Rule**  
- **Signals**: Local and simple.  
- **BehaviorSubject**: Shared and asynchronous.  
- **Combine both** if needed (e.g., BehaviorSubject for shared data, Signal for UI updates).
